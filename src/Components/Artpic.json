Often, this love exists in an invisible realm, perhaps only manifesting itself in moments of shared gazes. In this diptych, the artist captures moments of eye contact with her parents. These exchanges of glances occur in peculiar occasions, and within them lies the “possibility of non-existence.” “Is my father truly looking at me, or is it merely a fleeting glance as we pass by each other?” “Is my mother really gazing at me, or is she simply smiling playfully as the eyebrows become a mustache when viewed upside down?”",

Children’s education is normally assumed to be “innocent”, designed to prepare children for social integration by introducing social and cultural norms, fostering personal growth, and cultivating basic moral ethics. However, education also assumes the responsibility of introducing the concepts of culture, nation, and state. This kind of education is often instilled in other educational content.",

        "description":"The artist perceives a hallowed ambiguity in the foggy natural darkness. As human’s primary sense- sight- is surrendered to the night, the boundary between imagination and reality becomes ambiguous. Shapes, colors, and noises emerge from the veiled darkness, and they morph and blend by imagination. Submerging in this darkness also revives the raw and primal fear of the unknown, and the rush of adrenaline reawakens our animalistic connection to the wild. Inspired by the dramatic effect of flashlight photography, the artist contemplates the invasive nature of artificial light—its aggressive, stark nature, penetrating the murky darkness, serves as a metaphor for humanity's relentless expansion into natural landscapes. Thus, They Whisper suggests a contemplative discourse on how we, modern technology, and the untouched natural realm coexist in today's world. ",

In many ways, their patterns mirror those the Jersey residents, who lead busy lives but come together in the evening to unwind and connect.

Following the creation of the Waterfront Crowd Shot piece, this work continues to explore the artistic potential of using a flashlight in photography. The dramatic contrasts of light and dark emphasize the enigmatic quality of nature’s shadows. In contrast to photography, this painting features a surrealist foreground and experimental color speckles, which impart an unreal and illusory quality to the image.",

The stone’s unique holes, created by mollusks, and its symmetrical shape, coupled with a bright line in the middle, immediately caught the artist’s attention. The stone’s portability and aesthetic qualities prompted the artist to explore its spiritual significance, both as a singular artifact and in the context of traditional beliefs about hag stones and their perceived protective properties against evil. The artist’s recent fascination with Surrealism served as inspiration for this diptych. The backgrounds are reminiscent of Yves Tanguy’s depictions of landscapes, while the artist’s inclusion of time and contextual changes in the piece reflects the Surrealist exploration of time and space."
