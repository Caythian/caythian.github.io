    "description": "“How to Cut Out a Star” takes the form of a paper-cutting tutorial accompanied by the illustrative style of children’s magazines and primary school textbooks. Children’s education is normally assumed to be “innocent”, designed to prepare children for social integration by introducing social and cultural norms, fostering personal growth, and cultivating basic moral ethics. However, education also assumes the responsibility of introducing the concepts of culture, nation, and state. This kind of education is often instilled in other educational content.",
