            Xuecong Wang <span class="generaldessc">王雪聪</span> (IPA:/wɑŋ

            &ldquo;My art is about human, or perhaps it is not.
            It reflects on how, from a fragments of my experience, that a bigger picture of humanity unfolds.
            It is a bull charging into a vast variety of topics, mundane or peculiar.
            Society is a cold-blooded machine run by people with hearts.&rdquo;

          <div class="generaldes">
            My art investigates the presence of subjectivity in an era encouraging reason and objective thinking. It shows the reciprocal nurturing between internal, unquantified qualities of humanity-such as emotion, memory, and belief- and individuals&rsquo; perception of the external world. That is, for an individual, the fragment of the outer reality they choose to see often mirrors their soul.
          </div>
          <div class="generaldes">
            My interest lies in the stories and concepts characterized by the tension between human intuitive responses and their objective explanations. By recreating them from a peculiar angle like first-person perspective, my art highlights the immediacy of the human protagonist and their mental states.
