description:
  - "This project is inspired by my experience as an immigrant in America, navigating the complexities of the bureaucratic system. Holding a foreign passport brings many practical challenges, and through these difficulties, I recognize how bureaucratic processes can transform people into what philosopher Michel Foucault calls “docile bodies”—individuals made compliant through uniform procedures and documentation. "
  - "What becomes “docile bodies” here is the bodies of some dried osmanthus flowers. Collected, dried, and sent by my family in China, these flowers traveled to America through a similar process to immigration. In this manner, the image of the flowers, appearing as passport photos on the visa application forms, represents individuals flattened by bureaucratic routine. "
  - "However, this installation does not simply present a bleak vision of modern bureaucracy. As the audience draws closer to the installation, something invisible under the standardized images emerges: the fragrance of the flower, the subtle music, and handwritten notes telling the personal stories of the flowers. These elements reclaim human qualities untold on paper—the experience, memories, and cultural identities—but emerge through genuine human interactions."
