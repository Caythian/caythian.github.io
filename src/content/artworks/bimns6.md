description:
  - "This particular painting draws inspiration from the empathy for a tree in the neighborhood, for which I found its living condition at a busy crossroad somewhat similar to the one of myself: I too lived in a transitory space and time, in my 20s, venturing in a country far from home. This painting expresses the wish to would find happiness and serenity in the most mundane."
