description:
  - "The artist perceives a hallowed ambiguity in the foggy natural darkness. As human’s primary sense- sight- surrenders to the night, the boundary between imagination and reality becomes ambiguous. Shapes, colors, and noises emerge from the veiled darkness to morph and blend through imagination's power. Submerged in this darkness, the rush of adrenaline and the revival of the raw and primal fear of the unknown reawakens our animal connection to the wild."
