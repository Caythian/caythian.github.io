description:
  - "I love my foster cats, and in return, my foster experience inspired my art creation and my understanding of myself. The reason I love cats is not only because of their fluffiness. More and more, I see in cats a part of who I want to become: they are small yet resilient, independent yet loving, innocent-looking yet fierce when being offended. Therefore, it is fair to say that I am also cultivating a small version of myself when tending these tiny predators."
