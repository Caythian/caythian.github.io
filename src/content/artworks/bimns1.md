description:
  - "What a person stands for is often determined by where they sit. Similarly, what a person sees is often determined by who they are. “Because I Might Not See” is an ongoing series focusing on the synthesis between vision and mind, for this synthesis creates a subjective version of reality filtered with the artist’s agency. These moments depicted in this series aim to represent her ways of seeing, her points of interest, and thus, her identities."
