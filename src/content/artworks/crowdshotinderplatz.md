description:
  - "“The hooded crows took over the plaza. I saw them. Their eyes glittered in the dark.”"
  - "As a student studying oversea, the artist seeks to forge connections to her contexts, with both the human community and the natural elements, such as birds. During her stay in Berlin in 2023, she observed the gathering the crows. The mutual observation between herself and these birds became a metaphor for her experience as a foreigner mirrored her broader experience as a newcomer in foreign lands, where she found herself simultaneously in the roles of observer and observed, stranger and admirer."
