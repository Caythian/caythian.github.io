description:
  - "This artwork draws its motif from the artist’s childhood string game named Cat’s Cradle, interpreting it as a metaphor for inherent human connection beyond social confines. "
  - "(As the artist states), “I view this game as inherently utopian. It represents a form of non-linguistic communication conveyed through body gestures, visual patterns, and shared understanding of its unspoken rules. Its universal playability transcends age and geography, fostering connection across diverse cultures. Furthermore, this game has no ‘win’, meaning that it is sustained not by the individual pursuit of triumph but the collective will to engage.”"
