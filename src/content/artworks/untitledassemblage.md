description:
  - "Ceramic is usually regarded as a material requiring much care. In this piece, the artist challenges this concept by making modular pieces with ceramic and assembling them together like children’s stacking toys. The careless playfulness to the making of these forms contrasts with the fragile nature of the material itself."
