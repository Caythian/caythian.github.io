description:
  - "This painting explores how reality is represented in an intertwining web of objective reality, what people see, and what they remember. It captures the memory of experiencing the Broadway musical “The Lion King”, a performance that astounded the artist with its artistry. The resulting feeling of ecstasy manifests as an illusion of lingering traces of clapping hands. This piece reveals the beauty inherent in subjective perspective, particularly when interwoven with bodily sensations and emotions."
