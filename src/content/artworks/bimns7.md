description:
  - "I used to take myself way too seriously as an artist (plz tell me if I still am). If I’m being honest, I fell into that trap of thinking my work needed to be a profound commentary on society’s problems. I’d bury myself in research and then create these pieces that were supposed to be these deep visual essays full of symbolism. Despite all that effort, something always felt off. I was trying so hard to be insightful that I lost touch with what genuinely moved me. The lack of sincerity and the scarcity of genuine interest in the subject matter haunted some of my research-based work. I want to create something sincere, even when its sole purpose is to present a fragment of my memory. This fish piece is just about a fish in a tank; about how I was captivated by its perfect blend into its environment. That’s it. That’s the whole story."
