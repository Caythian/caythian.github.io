description:
  - "In this painting, the gradual expulsion of sutures from the body is a metaphor for uncovering mental pressures—anxiety, depression, loneliness—that often remain hidden. When sutures are gradually expelled out of organic tissues through the physiological process of healing, their subtle emergence denotes wounds that might otherwise go unnoticed. The absence of visible injury does not negate the existence of pain, and the invisibility of mental collapse does not diminish its reality. Both can be laid bare in  overlooked details such as expelled stitches."
