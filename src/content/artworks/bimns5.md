description:
  - "“Because I Might Not See” is an ongoing series focusing on the synthesis between vision and mind, for this synthesis creates dissonances among three levels of representing reality: objective reality, visual perception, and memory. This particular painting draws inspiration from a single moment during a date and reflects the artist’s understanding of personal relationships through the metaphor of tableware. Like shuffling tableware on a small table, maintaining personal relationships is an endless maneuver balancing care and boundaries, loneliness and intimacy, passion and sanity."
