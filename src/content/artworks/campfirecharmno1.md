description:
  - "Campfire Charm is an ongoing series focuses on UFO phenomena. UFO is the short-term for \"Unidentified Flying Object\", but often it bears connotation of a flying/floating/falling vehicle of extraterritorial aliens."
  - "People, unlike machines, would believe in something like love, ethics, as well as UFOs. These beliefs lie beyond the realm of reason and science, and they connect people together through the perceptual and experiential narratives. This project is a celebration of their existence."
