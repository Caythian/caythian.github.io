description:
  - "From my perspective, uniformity is a crucial factor in the formation of civilization. Without the standardization of basic units, whether in human interactions or machinery, it is impossible for us to function as a collective. One expected, yet often unmentioned, aspect of uniformity is found in musical instruments, which have undergone numerous modifications and standardizations to produce what society defines as “good music”."
  - "However, the relationship between instruments and people extends beyond merely producing good music. Inspired by the use of musical instruments in spiritual practices such as shamanism, and various ancient instruments, I have discovered that an instrument can foster a more intimate bond with its player. It is not merely a medium or intermediary for creating music; the act of playing becomes an enjoyment in itself, similar to other performing arts. In this series of works, I aim to explore alternative forms of instruments that prioritize “interaction with the performer” over “creating better music”."
