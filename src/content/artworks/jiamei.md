description:
  - "This work is inspired by found footage depicting a young girl faking to sleep in a department store, in the hope of staying in the store longer instead of going home. To reveal her lies, her parents test her to do something impossible— they claim that when people are truly sleeping, their limbs will stay in the air after being lifted. The parents then lift her arms and legs. Unsurprisingly, the little girl keeps her limbs hanging. Even when she gets tired and her body is trembling, she won't open her eyes at all."
  - "The act of faking sleep, or 假寐(Jia Mei), can be viewed as a metaphor of self-deception, characterized by retreat into the familiar and unchallenged. To stay in the comfort zone is to stay in a fever dream, and to intentionally ignore criticism or comply with acts that perpetuate a state of perceived security."
