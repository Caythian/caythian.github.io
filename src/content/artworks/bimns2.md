description:
  - "There was an interesting story about how my parents discovered that I have astigmatism: when I was five or six, my parents took me on a stroll after dinner and my mom asked, “Look at that street lamp, do you see light beams emitting from it and it kind of looks like a star?” “Yes.” They soon took me to see optometrists during the summer break. I guess this is when scotomaphobia emerged: while many doctors told them that it was just genetic, my parents wouldn’t give up on finding a cure. Hence, the fear of disappointing them on the next visit to doctors lingered and transformed into the irrational fear of losing vision and letting my loved ones down."
  - "Astigmatism will stay with me forever, as will the rest of the genetic info I inherited from my parents. I grew insensitive to its impact on my life most of the time, but sometimes—like the moment depicted in this painting—I became aware of it. But it was more than the feeling of fear being evoked here: these are also moments in which I feel alive. The keen awareness of the surroundings through human’s imperfect senses and our acknowledgment of this imperfection is the will to live."
