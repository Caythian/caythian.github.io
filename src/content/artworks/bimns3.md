description:
  - "One aspect of humanity that both terrifies and fascinates me is the [[exercise in futility]]. Whether it’s attempting to capture a clear image of a [[ghost]], trying to correct my astigmatism, or recreating the shape of filthy steam rising from a vent that I only glanced at for a moment—all these experiences illustrate this concept. This message is embodied in my pieces for this series: no matter what you do, no matter how realistically you can portray something, nothing can match reality itself. Therefore, I do not attempt to delineate a scene as lifelike as possible. Instead, I dedicate myself to portraying the memory of reality in my mind, knowing there’s no way to perfectly recreate what exists there. If you ask me what my paintings are about, the best I can say is that they are “a translation of a translation.”"
