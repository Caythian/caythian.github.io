description:
  - "This particular painting reveals the strange sense of acquaintance established through the act of observation. Inspired by the artist’s daily commute—during which she frequently observes an attendant in a basement parking lot—her constant wondering about his vantage point and whether he notices the downward gaze of passersby seems to intertwine the fates of observer and observed."
