description:
  - "This painting explores what lies literally inside me but remains largely unseen, even to myself. I can feel these ridges with my tongue, sense their swollen presence, but cannot directly observe them (unless in the way I got my reference: shuffling half of my phone in my mouth and taking a picture). This physical manifestation of mental pressure connects to the core theme of this series: the complex interplay between what we can perceive visually and what we experience through other senses, particularly when body and mind synthesize in some obscure ways. This peculiar framing underscores the hidden nature of both the physical manifestation and the underlying mental anxiety that precipitates it."
